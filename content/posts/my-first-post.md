Welcome to **our first blog post**!

In this post, we'll share why we chose Hugo and PaperMod for our new site and how you can create new posts easily using Markdown. Here are some points:

- **Fast & flexible**: Hugo is a static site generator that builds sites quickly.
- **PaperMod theme**: Clean, minimal design with light/dark modes.
- **Markdown content**: Write posts in Markdown, commit them to the `content/posts` folder, and they'll be automatically published.

To create new posts, simply add a new `.md` file in `content/posts/` with front matter like above. We'll cover more features in future posts!
